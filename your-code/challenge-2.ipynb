In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.\n","\n","Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.\n","\n","NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package is great for dummies to perform sentiment analysis because it requires only the textual data to make predictions. For example:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",">>> txt = \"Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide. \n","\n","Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do.\"\n",">>> analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n",">>> analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)\n","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}\n","```\n","\n","In this challenge, however, you will not use NLTK's sentiment analysis package because in your Machine Learning training in the past 2 weeks you have learned how to make predictions more accurate than that. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. You will be able to use the Na√Øve Bayes classifier you learned in the lesson to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the labels."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"x62v0po-z-CA"},"source":["## Conducting Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","### Loading and Exploring Data\n","\n","The dataset we'll be using today is located on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). Once you have downloaded and imported the dataset, it you will need to define the columns names: df.columns = ['target','id','date','flag','user','text']\n","\n","*Notes:* \n","\n","* The dataset is huuuuge (1.6m tweets). When you develop your data analysis codes, you can sample a subset of the data (e.g. 20k records) so that you will save a lot of time when you test your codes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"Z-c8AfU0z-CB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677857566460,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Tracy Nguyen","userId":"09196995759356698270"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# your code here"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tgGlI-yX5RRf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677857566460,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Tracy Nguyen","userId":"09196995759356698270"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PCZ6y0SO5mP7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677857568856,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2400,"user":{"displayName":"Tracy Nguyen","userId":"09196995759356698270"}},"outputId":"0dc15911-f29e-4f38-b048-f166ad95b682"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# load the dataset ans get the sample a subset of the data \n","training = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Ironhack/lab-nlp/training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1',\n","                       names=['target', 'id', 'date', 'flag', 'user', 'text']) # rename the columns direclt when download the dataset\n","\n","sample = training.sample(n=2000, random_state=42)\n","\n","sample.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"VLSazWu55Rb2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677857578845,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":9991,"user":{"displayName":"Tracy Nguyen","userId":"09196995759356698270"}},"outputId":"df0ce773-c2a7-4479-e8c3-3c2e461e1837"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        target          id                          date      flag  \\\n","541200       0  2200003196  Tue Jun 16 18:18:12 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY   \n","750          0  1467998485  Mon Apr 06 23:11:14 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY   \n","766711       0  2300048954  Tue Jun 23 13:40:11 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY   \n","285055       0  1993474027  Mon Jun 01 10:26:07 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY   \n","705995       0  2256550904  Sat Jun 20 12:56:51 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY   \n","\n","                   user                                               text  \n","541200  LaLaLindsey0609             @chrishasboobs AHHH I HOPE YOUR OK!!!
